I obtained my Ph.D. degree in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.uconn.edu/) at [University at Connecticut, UCONN](https://uconn.edu/) in May 2021, under the supervision of [Prof. Jinbo Bi](https://jinbo-bi.uconn.edu/),  M.S. in Statistics at University of California, Davis and B.S. in Mathematics at Zhengzhou University. My research interests include Machine Learning, Mathematical Optimization, Statistics, Deep Learning, Differential Privacy, Federated Learning and Recommender System.  My goal is to develop efficient and privacy-preserving optimization algorithms for machine learning, deep learning and federated learning.

I have intensively worked on various topics in machine learning, including nonconvex sparse learning, collaborative learning, federated learning and privacy-preserving machine learning. In the future, I plan to continue to pursue these directions. I also plan to expand my research to other application domains of machine learning, with potential collaborators inside the university as well as in industry. I am open to any collaboration.
